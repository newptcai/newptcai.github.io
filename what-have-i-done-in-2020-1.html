      <p>2020 started a bit bumpy for me. (No I am not talking about COVID.) On the first day of this year, I
was in a foreign country, suffering from a cold, taking a lonely flight back home, and heartbroken.
The consequence of that day lasted quite a bit time. And then COVID came.</p>
<p>I had often imagined that I would not mind to be a astronaut and going for a mission to Mars by
myself. COVID proved me wrong. In the early days when I was forced to work from home, I could barely
do anything.</p>
<p>But the isolation also forced to ask myself a tough question -- how should I live the rest of my
life? To find the answer, I began to read some books on my to-read list for ages. Here is what I
have learned and what I have done accordingly in 2020.</p>
<h2>Becoming a vegan</h2>
<p>I did not eat too much meat and diary in the past, but I never really thought about becoming fully a
vegetarian or vegan. My parents still tell stories about how exited I was when I was kid when there
was meat or fish on the table. I loved meat. Then I read this
<a href="https://www.eatlikeyoucarebook.com/">Eat Like You Care</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Eat Like You Care" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/what-have-i-done-2020/eat-like-you-care.jpg"></p>
<p>When I opened the book, I saw these lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dedicated to the approximately 57 billion land animals and one trillion aquatic animals we will
consume in the next year.</p>
<p>So much suffering.</p>
<p>So much death.</p>
<p>All so unnecessary.</p>
<p>All so wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tremendous sadness grabbed me and I read the whole book, which is actually quite short. It has
very simple argument for veganism</p>
<ol>
<li>We should not harm animals for no good reason</li>
<li>There is no good reason for most of us to consume animal products</li>
<li>There is tremendous harm done farming animals</li>
<li>Conclusion: So we should not eat animal products</li>
</ol>
<p>If you accept point 1, 2 and 3, there is simply no way to avoid the conclusion 4.</p>
<p>The book also reminded me of a little story which happened when I was in elementary school. It
rained heavily that day and the yard in front of our classroom became a pool. During a break, a
little mole emerged from the water and tried to swim to where I and other kids were standing, where
it was a bit high and still dry. For some reason, other kids found it funny to push the little
creature back to the water whenever it got close to us. They were laughing but I was appalled by the
cruelty. I was a shy boy and did dear to do anything. The left a shameful feeling even until today.</p>
<p><img alt="Mole" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/what-have-i-done-2020/mole.jpg"></p>
<p>But reading the book showed me that I should be much shameful for all the animals who died because I
liked the taste of their dead body. Some times I did that not even for the taste, but just to not to
annoy other people.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I also read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_(book)">Animal
Liberation</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer">Peter
Singer</a>. This book really make the tremendous scale of
animal suffering the agriculture industry clear to me. I cannot stop asking myself -- how can anyone
still eat things like veal if they know how it was produced?</p>
<p><img alt="Animal Liberation" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/what-have-i-done-2020/animal-liberation.jpg"></p>
<p>That was enough for me. Once I have learned the dark truth, I cannot forget about it. I can either
admit I was as coward as I was kid by keep eating what everyone else is eating, or I can do what I
know is right -- becoming a vegan.</p>
<p>The transition is actually quite easy, maybe thanks to the COVID. I have not been to any restaurant
since March. And once I avoided buy meat or diary during grocery shopping, I never had the urge to
go out just to buy a package of sausages. Occasionally I ate at university cafeteria. But they
always have a vegetarian option and it actually saved me the mental trouble of choosing what to eat.
I have also learn many vegan <a href="https://newptcai.github.io/how-to-fight-pandemic-cooking-at-home.html">recipes</a>. They are actually quite
delicious once you learned how to make them.</p>

<p>On the health side, I did find plant based food is much easier to digest and avoiding diary product
completely eliminated my occasional IBS sydrome. All in all, becoming vegan is one of the best
decision which I have made this year, if not this life.</p>
