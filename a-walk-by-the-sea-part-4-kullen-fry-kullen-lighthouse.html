<p><em>This is part 4 of the stories of my vacation in summer 2017 around west coast of Sweden.</em></p>
<p>In many way, this was a memorable day in my life. Yet it took me nearly 3 years to finally spend 30
minutes to write something about it. Life is not short. It's just we find excuses not to do things.</p>


<h2>Day 4 (2017-07-16) -- Kullen fry (Kullen lighthouse)</h2>
<p>When I started walking in the morning, it began to drizzle a bit. But instead of being worried I got
a bit excited because I have my rain jacket! I even sprayed it with water proof coating before I
left Uppsala. How well prepared I was! üòÅ</p>
<p>Very soon I realized how naive I was. My rain jacket was Okay, but my jeans were not water proof. So
I walked for 10 km in water soaked jeans until I got to the next town
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6lle">M√∂lle</a>. If you want to know how it felt like, just look
at the expression on my face.</p>
<p><img alt="The rain" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/02.jpg"></p>
<p>At the nice little cafe <a href="https://g.page/mollekrukmakeri?share">M√∂lle Krukmakeri</a>, I had one of the
most delicious tea and salad in my life. Socrates says hunger is the greats relish. I would say that
soak yourself in heaving rains for two hours also works.</p>
<p><img alt="Lunch" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/03.jpg"></p>
<p>I changed in a pair of dry jeans and began the final journey journey to the very tip of Kullen
peninsula. It was only 4 kilo meters on map, but this was 4 kilo meters hilly trails. And then the rain
began to pouring down and wind began to blow. That was a hell of a wind. At that I began to realize
three things -- </p>
<ol>
<li>Home is really good.</li>
<li>I probably won't get a sudden awakening of the meaning of life in this miserable situation, which
   was my initial aim of this trip. </li>
<li>I do not know what number to call for emergency in Sweden. </li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Wind" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/04.jpg"></p>
<p>Soon I found some company on the trail. People who are "stoic" are often compared with emotionless cow
standing in the rain. I think sheep are also quite stoic in this sense.</p>
<p><img alt="Sheep" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/05.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, the light house. Looks so unremarkable three years later. Yet at that time, I was so happy
to get there I took 20 photos of it. </p>
<p><img alt="Light house" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/06.jpg"></p>
<p>The wind was so strong there that I had to hold my hat all the time.</p>
<p><img alt="Light house" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/07.jpg"></p>
<p>If you look at this picture of the Kullen peninsula, you would be able to see where I started that
day. It is a little bit to the right end of the picture. I walked from there all the way to the tip
at the bottom. I did not learn what the meaning of life is. But I did learn that if you keep going,
sooner or later you will get to your destiny.</p>
<p>Hope my story may cheer you up a bit in the middle of a pandemic. üòÅ</p>
<p><img alt="Light house" src="https://newptcai.github.io/images/2017-07-16/08.jpg"></p>
<p>By the way, it was not a good idea to walk in heavy rains with your passport. It may never become
flat again.</p>
