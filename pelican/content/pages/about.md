I just finished a postdoctoral researcher at [the Department of Mathematics of Uppsala
University](https://www.uu.se/en) in Sweden.  My supervisor was [Cecilia
Holmgren](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N5-824). Currently I am taking a (hopefully) short break
from work at Montreal.

In my spare time, I like to read and think about [philosophy]({tag}philosophy).

## More about Me

Before I went to Canada, I had been a software engineer  in China for a long time.  When I immigrated
to Canada in 2010, I also worked for an Internet startup for about a year.

My undergraduate years was spent for a Computer Science  degree at [Xi'an Jiaotong
University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/en/) ([西安交通大学](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/)) in
[Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an)
(西安) China.

I grew up in [Sichuan province](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan) (四川), which is famous for
its spicy [Szechuan cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szechuan_cuisine)  and [panda
bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_Giant_Panda_Sanctuaries).
