My name is 蔡醒诗 or [Xing Shi Cai](https://goo.gl/B7HhNt "How to say it") in English.  I am
postdoctoral researcher at [the Department of Mathematics of Uppsala University
(Sweden)](https://www.uu.se/en).  My supervisor is [Cecilia
Holmgren](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N5-824).  Before that, I did my PhD in Computer Science
from [McGill University (Canada)](http://mcgill.ca) with [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org/). 


I am interested in probability, combinatorics, and [experimental
mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_mathematics).  The models that I study
include randomized algorithms, random graph and random trees.

Before I went to Canada, I had been a software engineer in China for a long time.  When I immigrated
to Canada in 2010, I also worked for an Internet startup for about a year.

My undergraduate years was spent for a Computer Science degree at [Xi'an Jiaotong
University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/en/) ([西安交通大学](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/)) in
[Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an)
(西安) China.

I grew up in [Sichuan province](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan) (四川), which is famous for
its spicy [Szechuan cuisine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szechuan_cuisine) and [panda
bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_Giant_Panda_Sanctuaries).

In my spare time, I like
[reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4410353-xing-shi?order=d&shelf=read) and
[hiking]({static}/images/me/10.jpg).  After when I moved to Uppsala, I started a [MeetUp hiking
group](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Evening-Hike-Group/).
