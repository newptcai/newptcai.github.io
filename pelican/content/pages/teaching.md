## How do I teach

When I was a PhD student in McGill University (Canada), I mostly gave lectures on algorithms and
programming. Now at Uppsala University, I teach mathematics.

When I teach, I always try to remind myself what [Doron
Zeilberger](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion128.html) (a pioneer in
computer-assisted proofs) wrote -- 

> *Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*
    
If I can, I always prefer concrete examples than doing a proof.

I like to use computer to create [teaching resources]({tag}teaching). Here are some material I
created for courses that I taught. Feel free to use any of them in your own teaching. You can also
contact me if you need the source code.

* [Combinatorics 1MA020, Spring 2019]({filename}/math/2019-03-21-combinatorics.md)

## Do you need a supervisor?

If you are a bachelor or master student at Uppsala University, I am happy to supervise you. You can
contact my previous students if you want to be sure if I am a good supervisor! ðŸ˜Š
