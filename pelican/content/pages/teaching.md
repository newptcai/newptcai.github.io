I like to use computer to create [teaching resources]({tag}teaching). Here are some material I
created for courses that I taught. Feel free to use any of them in your own teaching. You can also
contact me if you need the source code.

* [Several Variable Calculus 1MA017, Autumn 2019]({filename}/math/2019-11-19-calculus.md)
* [Combinatorics 1MA020, Spring 2019]({filename}/math/2019-03-21-combinatorics.md)

If you are a bachelor or master student at Uppsala University, I am happy to supervise you. My
previous students include
