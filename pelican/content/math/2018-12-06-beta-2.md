This is a continuation of [my previous post on beta distribution]({static}2018-12-01-beta.md).

My colleague Tilo wants me to use Sagemath instead of Mathematica, which turns out to be much harder. But now I have done it and we have a completely open source proof.

This is written in a Jupyter note book which can be downloaded [here]({static}/notebook/2018-12-06-beta-2.ipynb).
