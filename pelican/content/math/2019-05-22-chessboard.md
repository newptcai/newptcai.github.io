I created a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/newptcai/math-note/blob/v0.1.1/2019-05-22-chessboard.ipynb) for teaching induction in combinatorics to demonstrate that you can
always tile a $2^n \times 2^n$ chessboard which has one tile missing with L-shaped tiles. To see how it works,
run it on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/newptcai/math-note/v0.1.1?filepath=2019-05-22-chessboard.ipynb).
