Why models should be wrong --

> Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a "correct" one by excessive elaboration.
> On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural
> phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great
> scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity. (George
> Box)

Why you should not read math while watching TV --

> Although we hope that this book is entertaining in places, most of it, in fact, is rather dull
> except perhaps to the odd technical fanatics. Thus we do not recommend it for class notes or for
> reading during TV commercials. (Luc Devroye, Nonparametric Density Estimation: The L1 View)

Why you should not be too formal --

> An axiomatic presentation of a mathematical fact differs from the fact that is being presented as
> medicine differs from food ... Understanding mathematics means being able to forget the medicine and
> enjoy the food.  (Gian Carlo Rota, Indiscrete Thoughts)


Why you should not use "it's easy to see" in a paper --

> ... we all know that behind things that are easily seen there may
> be years of thinking and/or huge piles of scrap notes that lead nowhere,
> and one sheet where everything finally worked out nicely.  (Allan Gut, Probability: A Graduate
> Course)
