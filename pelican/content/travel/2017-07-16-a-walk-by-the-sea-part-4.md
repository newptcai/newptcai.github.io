*This is part 4 of the stories of my vacation in summer 2017 around west coast of Sweden.*

In many way, this was a memorable day in my life. Yet it took me nearly 3 years to finally spend 30
minutes to write something about it. Life is not short. It's just we find excuses not to do things.

##  Day 4 (2017-07-16) -- Kullen fry (Kullen lighthouse)

When I started walking in the morning, it began to drizzle a bit. But instead of being worried I got
a bit excited because I have my rain jacket! I even sprayed it with water proof coating before I
left Uppsala. How well prepared I was! üòÅ

Very soon I realized how naive I was. My rain jacket was Okay, but my jeans were not water proof. So
I walked for 10 km in water soaked jeans until I got to the next town
[M√∂lle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6lle). If you want to know how it felt like, just look
at the expression on my face.

At the nice little cafe [M√∂lle Krukmakeri](https://g.page/mollekrukmakeri?share), I had one of the
most delicious tea and salad in my life. Socrates says hunger is the greats relish. I would say that
soak yourself in heaving rains for two hours also works.

I changed in a pair of dry jeans and began the final journey journey to the very tip of Kullen
peninsula. It was only 4 kilo meters on map, but this was 4 kilo meters hilly trails. And then the rain
began to pouring down and wind began to blow. That was a hell of a wind. At that I began to realize
three things -- 

1. Home is really good.
1. I probably won't get a sudden awakening of the meaning of life in this miserable situation, which
   was my initial aim of this trip. 
1. I do not know what number to call for emergency in Sweden.

Soon I found some company on the trail. People who are "stoic" are often compared with emotionless cow
standing in the rain. I think sheep are also quite stoic in this sense.

Finally, the light house. Looks so unremarkable three years later. Yet at that time, I was so happy
to get there I took 20 photos of it.

The wind was so strong there that I had to hold my hat all the time.

If you look at this picture of the Kullen peninsula, you would be able to see where I started that
day. It is a little bit to the right end of the picture. I walked from there all the way to the tip
at the bottom. I did not learn what the meaning of life is. But I did learn that if you keep going,
sooner or later you will get to your destiny.

Hope my story may cheer you up a bit in the middle of a pandemic. üòÅ

By the way, it was not a good idea to walk in heavy rains with your passport. It may never become
flat again.
